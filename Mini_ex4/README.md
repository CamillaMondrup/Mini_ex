## About my program:
When making my program i wanted to do something with sound, because sound is something that the computer doesn't show. When a web-cam is in use, usually a light appears beside the webcam, and key-inputs is something that the user is aware that they are doing, but with audio-input, can you really ever know when something or someone is listening? 

The idea behind my program was to illustrate how a computer knows a lot about you from capturing various data about you. Obviously my program doesn'r really use the data that it captures for anything, but i made the program based on this concept of how much is our computers and other devises really able to tell about us, from what we uses them for?

My program actually captures audio input from the moment that you run the program, and not just when you press the start button, which the user will never know, unless they learn it from reading about the program. This is a feature that I made deliberately also to illustrate that even when you think that the computer only captures things that you actively submit yourself, this is not always the case. This is something that I learned in class, when we had a discussion about how much facebook actually knows about the users. When a user starts typing a status update, facebook tracks the keys that are pressed, even if the status-update is never published. I found this really disturbing, mostly because I think that most of us are not aware that this is the case.
