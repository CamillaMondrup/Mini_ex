### Describe your first independent coding process (in relation to thinking, reading, copying, modifying, writing, uploading, sharing, commenting code)
My first coding process has been a bit up and down. It took me some time to understand the syntax of even the simplest pieces of code, but after looking at different ones as well as watching videos on youtube.com by Daniel Shiffman I started to get a better understanding of the basics of coding with P5.js. 

My initial idea was to write a piece of code that would display a word that blinked or changed colour, sort of flashing constantly. I searched and googled but I couldn't figure out how I could make the text flash, so I gave up and decided to do something different. It was kind of frustrating to imagine something, but then not have the ability to create It. I then decided to find an example instead and try to work from that.

I watched a video about the random function as well as one about variables and how to make your own and decided that I wanted to do something with that. I wanted to do something like in the video where small circles popped up in different places in the canvas, but with variables I made myself. From the video I sort of had a starting point and from there I could change the variables to make the program more my own.  For an example I added a variable called size and used that to control the size of the circles. Because I wanted the circles to have different sizes I used the random function again which worked out fine. 


### How your coding process is differ or similar to reading and writing text? (You may also reflect upon Annette Vee's text on coding literacy)
My very first experience with coding, has taught me that you need to be very precise when writing so that the machine can understand what you are trying to say. When you read and write regular text, it really doesn't matter If you don't understand everything in the text, or if there are grammar mistakes in the text you are writing. The one who will read it, will probably understand the most important points. 
If you are missing only a single ";" in some of the code, the program will not run. And it can be extremely frustrating when you don't know why something is not working, only to find out that it was a tiny character that is missing. You have to be a lot more precise when talking to a computer. 


### What might be the potential and possibility of coding practice?
I imagine the possibilities of coding practice to be a lot. I find it difficult to sort of grasp all of the possibilities and potential, because I don't much about the field. For me I am excited to learn because I imagen that it will be a different way for me to express myself creatively and I also think it will be very useful in the future. If I am to work with engineers or computer scientist, it will definitely be an advantage to know the basics of their language in relation to communication and co-operation and so on.
