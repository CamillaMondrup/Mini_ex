Describe how does your game/game object works?
My game is a very simple game that is about how fast the user can remove all the “planets” from the screen. When all the planets are gone from the screen the program shows the user how much time they spent, and tells the user how to start again to try and improve on their score. 

Unfortunately I couldn’t figure out how to sort of restart the game. Initially I wanted to make a restart button, that the user could press to try again, but I couldn’t make it work. 

Describe how you program the objects and their related attributes and methods in your game.
The objects in my program are the planets and their attributes I decided to be their position on the canvas (xpos, ypos), their size (r) and their colour (farve). I assigned values to the different attributes and then made an array that contains the objects from my class. I decided that their should be 15 objects in my array, but since it is an array and the objects are made from a class, I can very easily change the number if I want more or less objects/planets to appear. 
The methods of my objects are move, show and contains. The move method i created to make the planets move a little bit, when they appear on the screen. The show method draws the planets, with the attributes I made. The contains method tells the program if the mouse is inside or outside the circle, which I later used to remove a circle if it is clicked on.

Based on Shiftman's videos, Lee's text and in-class lecture, what are the characteristics of object-oriented programming?
I understand the characteristics to be that the class works as a sort of template or blueprint, for all the objects that fit into that category. It makes it possible to code systems that resemble those of the real world more. You are able to define objects by assigning them different attributes and “abilities” just like you cane define things in the real world. 


Extend/connect your game project to wider digital culture context, can you think of a digital example and describe how complex details and operations are being abstracted and encapsulated?
I think that an example like facebook is really good at showing how abstraction can affect our digital culture. When making a facebook profile, you have to check different boxes to try and define who you are. You have to choose between man and woman, and also I believe that you have to choose between different predefined tags when selecting your interests and so on. All of these choices that the programmers have made, is an example of how coding can never be neutral. When making facebook and also all sorts of other pages and games, the programmer must choose what Hvor er du?  Finds important and thereby exclude something else, and therefore the programmers and people in charge have a lot of power when shaping our digital culture.
