    Who are you collaborate with?
    This program was created together with Ester from my study group.
    A screenshot of your program
    A title of your program
    A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/. (if it can't run on a browser, provide a short video documentation? (or animated gif))
    What is the program about? which API have you used and why?
    (individual)Can you describe and reflect your process of making this mini exercise in terms of acquiring, processing, using and representing data? How much do you understand this provided data? How do platform providers sort the data and give you the selected data?
    (individual)Try to formulate a question in relation to web APIs or querying processes that you want to investigate further when you have more time.
