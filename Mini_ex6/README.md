### What are the rules in your generative program and describe how your program performs over time. What have been generated?

The rules in my program are:
1. Use only circles
2. The circles fall from the top of the screen to the bottom
3. When a circle reaches the bottom it starts from the top again

My program starts with a blank page the size of the window, and soon after the program has been started, drops with different colours starts to fall from the top to the bottom of the screen. Every drop has a different colour, size and move at different speed. The drop also changes size while falling from top to bottom, which makes it look like a drop of paint. 
Over time the screen fills up with diffrent colours and evolves all the time and it is never the same pattern that is created. 

### How does this mini-exericse help you to understand what might be generativity? (see the above - objective 3)
I think that generativity as i understand it is when something is generated and is evolving on its own. By that i mean, that the programmer/artist is not completly in control, but the program sort of generates it self. Obviously there cannot be any program without a programmer to implement the code, but when making a generative program the programmer is most likely not able to predict the outcome, which i find really interesting and fun to play around with. 
In my program i used the random function a lot, to make the program more diverse and interesting to look at. Even though i used this function, I used it in a controlled way, if you can say so. I typed the random function and then typed specific values that the program could "choose" between, so that I could sort of control the colours. I wanted the colours to be sort of muted, so therefor I implemented that the random function could only use values between a specific set of numbers, to make sure that it chose the colours i wanted. In that way the outcome of my program is not completely random.
