**The Generative Raven**
I collaborated with [Nina](https://github.com/nborgbjerg) from my study group.

### About our program:
Our program I like to think of as a sort of poem-generator. The starting point of our program is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe called the Raven. We chose a verse from the poem to use as a template for creating new poems. We selected particular words from the original verse and divided them into four different categories: nouns, verbs, adjectives and pronouns. From some of the other verses in the poem we chose words that fit into these categories, so that we could change the original words with other words. 

Our goal was to use a program to generate new poems, but we had to figure out how we could do it so that the new poems would still make sense and be readable to a human. We decided to use some of the rules that are already in function in relation to human language. The syntax, how you structure sentences with different kinds of words, became our focus, because we thought that to be the simplest way to make sure that the poems would make at least a little bit of sense. In our minds we thought that if we switched a noun with another noun, we would ensure that the poems would end up somewhat understandable - and I actually think they sort of did! Obviously we did not have a lot of time to perfect the syntax and so on, so the program is not able to create the sentences perfectly. I think that to achieve this it would require a much more advanced code and a lot more grammatical and code-related rules to work. 

### What is the aesthetic aspects of your program in particular to the relationship between code and language?
When trying to generate literature using code/a program there will always be the question of whether the computer is able to capture the meaning and understanding of the words, sentences and syntax. As it is explained in the text Vocable Code a computer is not (yet) able to derive meaning of words: “If the machine is considered to lack a soul, it is because it manipulates symbols but does not understand them or produce meanings in them” p.32 A computer program may very well be able to manipulate words and symbols as it does in our program, but that does not mean that what the program creates necessarily makes sense or is good poetry. 

The text also mentions how meanings cannot only be analysed with a logical and rule-based approach:  “The meaning of words are not derived from an inherent logical structure alone (…) but also from their social use.”p. 32 That the meaning of different words depends of many other factors and not only what type of word it is, but also the relation to other words, social use and many other factors. It is exactly these many different factors that makes it so difficult to capture in a computer program, but maybe one day we are able to reconstruct the human ability to use and manipulate language.
